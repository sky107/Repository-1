 ## Unit 1 - Introduction to Postman

 ### Lesson 1 - Welcome

 #### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas

 ### Lesson 2 - What is Postman?

 #### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- Postman is a tool that allows us to easily work with APIs
- Postman is used to build HTTP requests that we sent to the server running the API

 ### Lesson 3 - How to install Postman

 #### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- there are two ways to run Postman: 1. as a standalone app or 2. directly in the browser
- the standalone app is available for Windows, macOS and Linux
- Postman on the web works from any browser but you may need to download the Postman Desktop Agent if your requests fail
- DO NOT use the Google Chrome extension as this is deprecated and no longer updated

 #### ðŸ“š - Resources
 
 * [Download Postman App](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
 * [Open Postman on the web](https://go.postman.co/build)
 * [Postman Desktop Agent (scroll down)](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

 ### Lesson 4 - Your first request with Postman

 #### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas

 - to use an API you need to read the API documentation
 - work is Postman is organized in Workspaces
 - a status code 200 (or any status like 2XX) indicates that the request was successful

 #### ðŸ“š - Resources
 
 * [Simple Books API documentation](./simple-books-api.md)


### Lesson 5 - HTTP

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas

- the API we are using use the HTTPS protocol
- HTTPS stands for Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- HTTPS ensures that the connection is encrypted
- all APIs should use HTTPS
- from our point of view HTTP and HTTPS are the same
- the HTTP request message will contain: 
* URL (address)
* Request method (GET, POST, PUT, ...)
* Headers (User-Agent: Postman)
* Body
- the HTTP response message will contain: 
* Status code (200, 404, 500, ...)
* Headers
* Body

### Lesson 6 - Postman collections and variables

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- you can save requests so that you can re-use them later on
- all requests need to be added to a Postman collection
- typically you will have a Postman collection for each API
- we are storing the base address of the API in a collection variable called `baseUrl`
- variables allow us to avoid repeating the same information
- variables allow us to easily make changes
- a Postman variable has two states
* INITIAL VALUE - this will be available to others if you share the collection
* CURRENT VALUE - this is private to you and this is the value that Postman uses


### Lesson 7 - Query parameters

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- JSON is the most popular format that APIs use to send data
- query parameters start after the `?` in the URL
- the format is `key=value`
- muliple query parameters are delimited in the URL with an `&`. Example: `foo=1&bar=2`
- depending on the API, some query paramters can be optional or mandatory
- a response status 400 indicates an issue with the request data
- you can enable and disable parameters by clicking the checkbox associated with each key-value pair

### Lesson 8 - Assignment
- study the API documentation and use the `limit` query parameter in the `/books` endpoint
- try out different values
- can you make the API return a status code 400?


### Lesson 9 - Path variables

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- `:bookId` is a path variable in the URL
- this endpoint allows us to specify a value that changes all the time, depending on the book
- `:bookId` is just a placeholder and does not get sent
- you can use path variables in combination with query parameters (if the API accepts this)


### Lesson 10 - POST request / API Authentication

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- a `POST` request allows you to send data in the request body
- the endpoint for submitting orders requires authentication
- some APIs/endpoints are public and require no authentication
- other APIs/endpoints are private are require authentication
- an access token is temporary password generated by the API
- to send JSON, select the POST request method and from the Body select `Raw` and from the list `JSON`

### Lesson 11 - JSON format

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- you need to specify valid JSON, otherwise the server won't understand your request
- use double-quotes for strings, separate key-value pairs with a comma sign `,`
- numbers, booleans don't need to be between quotes
- Postman will indicate when your JSON is invalid


### Lesson 12 - Assignment

- create the POST request to order a book
- try ordering a book that is not in stock

### Lesson 13 - Random test data

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- you can use a special type of Postman variables to generate random data
- example: `{{$randomFullName}}`
- to inspect the request body you can use the Postman console

 #### ðŸ“š - Resources
 
 * [Dynamic variables in Postman](https://postman-quick-reference-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dynamic-variables.html)

### Lesson 14 - Is Postman the right tool for me?

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- Postman is tool for dealing with APIs
- Postman cannot work with User Interfaces, click buttons and fill out forms
- Postman is not a performance testing tool
- Postman can be used for security testing but has not been designed for this purpose

### Lesson 15 - Viewing existing orders

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- using the GET request methid on the `orders` endpoint will give us a list of orders
- using the POST request method on the same endpoint will let us create a new order

### Lesson 16 - Assignment

- look at the API documentation and indentify the endpoint that would allow you to see a single order

### Lesson 17 - PATCH request

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- a `PATCH` request is typically used for updating existing data
- a `PATCH` usually does a paritial update, by changing only some of the properties

### Lesson 18 - DELETE request

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- a `DELETE` request is typically used for updating deleting data
- if you try to get the same data with a `GET` request, you will get a `404 Not Found` status code

## Unit 2 - Test automation with Postman

### Lesson 19 - Introduction to test automation

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas

- in this second part of the course, our goal is to automate the testing of the API
- so far we have done manual testing but we want to write API tests that allow us to avoid having to manually restest the API

### Lesson 20 - Your first API tests

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- we are looking at the response to understand if the API is working properly
- with API tests we want to avoid a manual re-test the API
- tests in Postman are written in JavaScript
- tests are executed ONLY after the response has arrived from the API
- Postman uses an assertion library called Chai.js
- testing the response status code is one of the most easiest tests you can write
- when writing tests, we want to make sure the tests will fail
- to make the assertions on a JSON response, you first need to parse it
- to see the contents of a JavaScript variable you can use `console.log`
- to get a property of an object, you can use this syntax: `someobject.someproperty`
- alternative syntax: `someobject["someproperty"]`

 ### Lesson 21 - Assignment
 - add tests for all the requests in the collection that verify the status code

### Lesson 22 - Postman variables

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas 
- Postman variables are a fundamental to automating testing of the API
- Postman environments (environment variables) are good if you have multiple testing environments (localhost, testing, production)
- Postman collection variables are saved in the collection
- Postman global variables are available to all collection in a workspace
- we use Postman global variables as the data we save if not that important after the execution has stoped

 * [How to set up different URLs in Postman using environment variables](https://youtu.be/HiIJbmjeTPU)

### Lesson 23 - Extracting data from the response

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas

- having hardcoded values in requests can make the API tests fail if the data changes
- use are using the filter function available on all arrays to remove the books that are not available
- always use `console.log` to view the data you are trying to set as a variable

#### ðŸ“š - Resources
 
 * [Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)

### Lesson 24 - Assignment
- test that the book extracted from the response is of type `non-fiction`
- ensure that the test fails

### Lesson 25 - Assignment
- use the Postman global variable `bookId` in the requests "Get single book" and "Order book".
- write a test that verifies the stock is >0
- use this assertion as a starting point: `pm.expect(1).to.be.above(2)`

### Lesson 26 - Collection runner

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas

- the Collection runner is a built-in functionality of Postman
- the Collection runner allows you to execute the entire collection with just one click
- make sure to check the "Save respose" box as this will allow you to inspect the response body

### Lesson 27 - Request execution order

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- If you run a Postman collection, the default order is as you have it in the collection
- you can change that order if you use `postman.setNextRequest` and specify the name of the next request
- if you wish to stop the execution prematurely, you can so so by running `postman.setNextRequest(null)`

#### ðŸ“š - Resources
 
 * [Advanced workflows (request chaining) with Postman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWYKOR0Zj28)

### Lesson 28 - Postman monitors

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- creating a Postman monitor ensure that you can run a Postman collection according to a predefined schedule
- running the collection will be handled by Postman on their infrastructure, you don't need to keep Postman open
- if you are not faimilar with continous integration servers like Jenkins, GitLab CI or TeamCity, this is a quick and easy way to access a Postman collection
- the API needs to be accessible from any network

### Lesson 29 - Newman

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- Newman is a CLI tool that can take a Postman collection, run all the tests and generate a report at the end
- Newman does not have an interface, you need to work with it from the terminal
- often Newman is installed on an integration server like Jenkins, GitLab CI or TeamCity
- to run Newman on your computer, you need to have Node.js installed.
- you can download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (download the LTS version)
- to install newman, run the command: `npm install -g newman`
- check if newman is install with: `newman --version`
- there are three ways to access a collection from Newman:
* export the collection as a JSON file
* share with a public link
* use the Postman API to get the collection

 * [Postman API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/631643/JsLs/?version=latest)

### Lesson 30 - HTML reports with Newman

#### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
- htmlextra is the most popular reporter in the Postman community

#### ðŸ“š - Resources

 ### Lesson 31 - CI/CD overview
 
 #### ðŸ’¡ - Main ideas
 - Newman is particulary useful when you integrate it with a CI server
