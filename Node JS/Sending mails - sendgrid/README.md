You cannot create your mailing server easily to process mass mails to user and scale performance becuase it requires complex knowledge.


We use nodemailer to integrate with some third party services like SendGrid, AWS, etc.

SendGrid
--------

npm install --save nodemailer nodemailer-sendgrid-transport

Now with API Key from dashboard and verifying sender detail we can proceed with code as demonstrated i)nside server.js

Note : In the code you mention the email that was given during sender detail entry inside dashobard
