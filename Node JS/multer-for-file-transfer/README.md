 Multer is a npm package which adds as an extra milldleware  in express for handling mulipart-form-data , so Traditionaly when we send a request its string encoded ,but it we want to transfer files from user to server machine we need to mention in form that data is of type multipart-formdata , followed by addtitoin of multer code in server , it offer management and transition from buffer stream auto and with few other functions we can manage mimetype, filedestination, filename, etc. now we can save path to mongo db and expose some folder directroy as static from express . This is very very usefule if we are constructing system where handling user resumes, docs , etc. So finally I can plan an alternative to Google Classroom if used with socket.io.
