Conecpt of Lazy Loading
-------------------------
React code gets compiled to js bundle to split that bundle we use lazy loading with fallback as loading component , implemented by Suspence wrapper





Concept of Memoization (useMemo())
-----------------------
To prevent unnecessary re-render of components , and only re-render when props associated with them changes.







Concept of useCallback (useCallback())
------------------------
In ES6, function is object , every re-render it gets created so static functions should be wrapped with empty dependecy and others with suitable dpeencencies











UI Code Quality Improvement
---------------

Max use of Moudular CSs , less use of Inline css
