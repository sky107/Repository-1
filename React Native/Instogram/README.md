Note: Front End Ready , Backend Ready now to retrive data/send data axios/fetch/HTTPWebdsocket use is left . Getting Network Error , I asked in community they said cors error I removed cors still network error working maybe I nerd to host the api as maybe 'localhost' does not recognize. I tested the api on REACTJS Single page application its working fine but on react native Network Error. Once I get this I'll upload the link for fully active app on iOS Emulator
